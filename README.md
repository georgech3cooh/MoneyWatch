# MoneyWatch

### Introduction

MoneyWatch is a web application that was created to help manage my money and investments.
The focus of MoneyWatch is on bank registers (Savings/Checking/Debt) and investment portfolio
and returns tracking (Stocks/Mutual Funds).

### Goals

This is one of my personal projects that I work on in my spare time, usually each month during bill paying time! ;)

The original goal was to track my own money and investments while tackling some of the pain points of my
former money management tool (the late M$ Money 2002).  MoneyWatch does some things very well,
and others it just doesn't do at all.


### What is it made out of?

MoneyWatch is a mix of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript on the front-end and Python on the back-end with MySQL data storage.
Frameworks used include a mix of jQuery, jQuery UI, YUI 3, and HighCharts for graphing.

### Installation
* Install using the /installation/moneywatch-db.sql file to start out with an empty database.
* Edit /cgi-bin/moneywatchconfig.py and enter the database connection information and log file locations.
* Point your webserver at it and visit moneywatch.html
